Shared Counter Example
======================
Introduction
------------
In this example we evaluate various ways of implementing a program that
launches N threads, which each execute a critical section X times,
such that the total number of critical section executions equals:
X/N - 100,000,000

Building
--------
`make`
builds a version for 5, 50 and 500 threads for each of the locking schemes:
 * `pthreads` uses pthreads directly: `counter_pthreads{5,50,500}`
 * `std` uses `std::mutex` and `std::lock_guard` for locking: `counter_std{5,50,500}`
 * `qd` uses QD locking as provided by this library: `counter_qd{5,50,500}`

Comparison with atomic instructions
-----------------------------------
For comparison, this example includes code that implements the critical section
using atomic instructions. While this is not executing the same code that the
other locking methods use, it shows the "optimal" implementation for this
particular example program, using an already thread-safe "critical" section.

`make atomics`
additionally builds versions using atomic instructions instead of locks.

Running
-------
You can use the following command to view output including runtimes:
    for counter in *5 *50 *500; do ./$counter; echo; done


Results
-------
**This is not a benchmark:**
These example programs do not try to minimize variation of results. E.g., the
worker threads start working immediately, not when all threads are spawned.
The workload in this example also is not representative of any real world load.
However, the numbers below show how much time is spent on synchronization in
different implementations.
