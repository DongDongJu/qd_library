Shared Counter Example
======================
Introduction
------------
In this example we evaluate various ways of implementing a program that
launches N threads, which each execute a critical section X times,
such that the total number of critical section executions equals:
X/N - 100,000,000

Building
--------
make
builds a version for 5, 50 and 500 threads for each of the locking schemes:
a) pthreads uses pthreads directly: `counter_pthreads{5,50,500}`
b) std uses `std::mutex` and `std::lock_guard` for locking: `counter_std{5,50,500}`
c) qd uses QD locking as provided by this library: `counter_qd{5,50,500}`

Comparison with atomic instructions
-----------------------------------
make atomics
additionally builds versions using atomic instructions instead of locks.

Running
-------
You can use the following command to view output including runtimes:
    for counter in *5 *50 *500; do ./$counter; echo; done
